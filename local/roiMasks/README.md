# Making ROI masks with Neurosynth

Neurosynth allows one to extract *a priori* regions of interest for roi based analyses and masks. This function was once made available on their website but has now been pushed off to a set of python based tools, [examples found here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/neurosynth/neurosynth/blob/master/examples/neurosynth_demo.ipynb). This directory contains the scripts I used to generate masks for this study and relevant statistics.
